### Demographics resources

Resources that are involved in the response to a demographics query. The response will always be in a Bundle resource containing the resources that match the search. They will be a combination of Patient and other resources linked in a graph (or web) of resources by the references between them.

The following diagram shows the relationship between the key resources.

The resources that are needed are:

| Resource | Purpose/s |
| --- | --- |
| Patient | Represents the patient - the subject of the encounter. Generally there will be a single Patient resource for each patient  <a href="http://clinfhir.com/logicalModeller.html#blf51" target="_blank">Model</a>  | 
| Encounter | The resource that represents a single encounter with a patient - such as a hospital admission. <a href="http://clinfhir.com/logicalModeller.html#nal0r" target="_blank">Model</a>|
| Practitioner | Represents a person delivering healthcare (regardless of qualification). There are 2 usages in this Use Case - the General Practitioner and the Admitting clinician. <a href="http://clinfhir.com/logicalModeller.html#87aoz" target="_blank">Model</a> |
| PractitionerRole | Is a link to a practitioner in a role - as well as a location and organization. It is used here to link the patient to their usual GP and GP Practice <a href="http://clinfhir.com/logicalModeller.html#awiqv" target="_blank">Model</a>|
| Location | Refers to a place where healthcare is delivered - in this case a Hospital <a href="http://clinfhir.com/logicalModeller.html#p8hy1" target="_blank">Model</a>|
| Organization | A group responsible for delivering care. The DHB is an example of this. <a href="http://clinfhir.com/logicalModeller.html#fkxor" target="_blank">Model</a>|
| Endpoint | Where information can be sent electronically <a href="http://clinfhir.com/logicalModeller.html#sbauk" target="_blank">Model</a>|


_(Each resource will likely have it's own API to be used by the client application assembling the Discharge Summary. However, there are a number of ways that the APIs can be structured according the the details of the use case - and the degree to which the 'work' should be performed by the client or the server. For example the client could first retrieve the Encounter resource, then the individual linked resources via separate calls. Alternatively, there could be a custom operation that retrieves all the resource in a single call - though this is a less flexible approach, and can require client customization.)_

### Laboratory test

Resources involved in Lab test reporting - especially blood tests and swabs.

| Resource | Purpose/s |
| --- | --- |
| <a href="http://clinfhir.com/logicalModeller.html#cfv1w" target="_blank">DiagnosticReport</a>  | Metadata about the test such as who performed it and panel grouping |
|<a href="http://clinfhir.com/logicalModeller.html#f5tym" target="_blank">Observation</a> | The individual result. It is possible for more than one result be be in a single Observation (If it has components) but that will be unusual in this implementation |
